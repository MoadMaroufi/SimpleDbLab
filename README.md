# SimpleDB Project: DBSYS course at EURECOM.

## Overview
This project involves the implementation of SimpleDB, a basic database management system, as part of the DBSYS lab assignments. The focus of this implementation is on the core modules required for accessing stored data on disk.

## Key Features Implemented
- Core data structures for managing database files and records
- Basic query processing capabilities
- File and buffer management systems
- Simple query execution engine

## Project Scope
The current implementation covers the fundamental aspects of a database system, including:
- Data storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Basic query processing
- Buffer pool management
- Catalog management

Note: Advanced features such as transaction control, locking mechanisms, and support for concurrent queries were not part of this implementation phase.

## Technology Stack
- Java

## Testing
The implementation was verified using:
- JUnit tests provided with the project
- Additional unit tests for specific functionalities

## Future Enhancements
Potential areas for future development include:
- Implementation of transaction control
- Adding support for concurrent query processing
- Enhancing query optimization techniques

## Reflections
This project provided valuable insights into the internal workings of a database management system, particularly in areas of data storage, retrieval, and basic query processing. It highlighted the complexities involved in efficient data management and the importance of well-designed data structures in database systems.
